# Hi! I'm Pax🥬

### Welcome to my digital garden🌱 or my Second brain🧠

This is a place where I share all of my notes. Most of these notes are my ideas in progress. These notes are inspired from Niklas Luhman's [[Zettelkasten System]]. 


- **How to navigate my [[second brain]]🧠?**
	- There's no navigation to start from. You can start with a note and start diving deep into a diverse ecosystem of ideas. 
	 **Or**
	- You can view the [[graph view]] at the end of notes and start exploring ideas. 

	- Here's a good way to start:
		- [[Books📚]]: This contains notes from the books I've read. I get most of the ideas from reading books. Dive in.
		- [[Courses💻]]: These are the courses I've took and key notes from those courses. Most of these courses are free.
		- [Blog](https://prakashjoshipax.com): If you are interested in reading more refined ideas, you can go to my blog or subscribe to my newsletter.

### Beware
- You are free to roam anywhere from here. But remember, some ideas or notes might be difficult to understand. It's because **these notes are not written for you**. They are written for myself. To aid and evolve my thinking, to help me learn, to create and explore ideas.

> The purpose of writing and publishing these notes is to practice [[Learning in public]] & [[building in public]].
