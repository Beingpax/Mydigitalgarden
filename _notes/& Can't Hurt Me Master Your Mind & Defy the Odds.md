Chapter 1:
- You're in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft that you will die without ever realizing your true potential.
- You're not a victim. Your life is 100% in your hands. Ditch the victim mentality. Own your life and every part of your life. 
- Repeat things you want to do and things you want to accomplish. Repeating will create a callous around your mind. 
- The mission of life is to have a better and greater impact on the world.
- There are many things that you know are true, but are false actually. Just because you believe something doesn't mean it is true. 
- People are addicted to comfort roaming around the streets like dead-eyed zombies. They are not aware of their potential. 
- The comfort is kills you again and again and again till you no longer are able to stand up. 


We all make habitual and self-limiting choices. Its easy to make the same comfortable choices that are killing you. We have wired our brain that way. No motivational video, or quick self-help fix will help you uplift your life. 

Some people will want to set in limit on you by showing science and previous achievements. But remember:

> There's something to be said for living it instead of studying it. 

It requires a lot of heart, will, and an armored mind to do things people call impossible. You have to walk on the path of self-mastery. Hold yourself accountable, push past pain, learn to love what you fear, live to your fullest potential and find out who  you really are. 

If you are driven towards your goal, anything infront of you will become a fuel for metamorphosis. If not, you will use it as an excuse.

> When you take the path of least resistance, you create another problem instead of solving it. 

##### Practice 1: Acknowledge the abuses, bullies and insecurities and write it down in your journal and share it publicly. It might be hard but it will empower you to overcome

It's possible to transcend anything that doesn't kill you. 
Now is the time to be real with yourself. Don't try to sugarcoat. Hold yourself accountable. No one is coming to save you. Not your father, mother, brother or any one else. You are only up to you. 

The only way you can change is by being raw real with yourself. If you don't know anything and haven't take life seriously, tell yourself so. Tell yourself that you need to get your ass to work because you're falling behind in life. 

Tell truth with yourself. Even if it hurts. Is it better to feel better for sometime and stay the same or to feel bad for sometime and change. 

> Tell yourself the truth! That you’ve wasted enough time, and that you have other dreams that will take courage to realize, so you don’t die a fucking pussy.

We avoid what we need to hear most. But not anymore. 

There's nothing in the world thats stopping you from excelling in life. You are stopping yourself. 

Its okay to be cruel with yourself as long as you realize you're doing it to become better. 

Being soft is not gonna work. You need to have a thick skin if you want to improve your life. 

> Find your own table and eat alone. Crave discomfort everywhere you go. 

Face uncomfortable experiences and those will make you tough. And being tough and resilient will help you meet your goals. 

If you live with a purpose, it will change everything. 

***Don't be motivated, be driven.***

If you want to grow, you will have to push yourself to the edge of mortality. You have to accept the possibility that you might die because you will not quit this time. 

In your training, you have a choice to choose between the physical suffering of the moment or the mental anguish of wondering if that last rep or minute or mile would end up costing an opportunity of lifetime. 

> Its not about who you were, Its about who you want to be.

If you want a calloused mind, you have to step out of your comfort zone on a regular basis. You have to do things that you don't like to do, things that make you uncomfortable, things that are good for you but scares you. 

You don't want to move your life instantly, you move it bit by bit by making the changes sustainable
