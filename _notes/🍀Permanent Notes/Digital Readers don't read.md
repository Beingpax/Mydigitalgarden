Digital readers don't read like others. Heck, they don't even read. They skimp.

They have too many things fighting their attention. They quickly skimp to see if they have anything valuable to takeaway from there.

They make judgments in mini-seconds to whether something is worth their time or not. 

They only start reading after they are convinced that there's something that speaks to their interests.
