Our enemy is not the lack of preparation or the difficulty of the project, our enemy is the resistance. If you give your brain time to think, it will start producing excuses, justification, and a million reasons why you can’t/ shouldn't/ won’t do what you need to know.

Good things only happen to people who begin before they are ready. Because guess what? You are never ready. Therefore, whatever you are supposed to do, start before you are ready.

Don't overthink. Don’t overprepare. Don’t spend all of your time planning on how you will finish the work. Don’t work on getting out every detail. Just outline it. On instinct.

We have to work not prepare for work.
