Life never stops teaching you. If you accept that and never let anything stop you from learning, you can get way ahead in life. 

Being a perpetual learner is the most important skill for getting rich. You have to know how to learn anything you want. Now you have to be a fast learner because most of things you know today will be obsolete four years later.

Therefore, you can't depend upon the old ways of making money by going to school, getting degree and working for thirty years. This will never put you on a path to financial success. You have to adopt a mindset of a perpetual learner.
