We all have limited time. You can't divide your time to many things. You can't say yes to everything that comes your way. If you can't decide , the answer is no. You should have a mental filter of "Hell yeah or Hell No". 
Life is full of opetions. Some decisions are long-lived such as marrying, starting a business, etc. Therefore it is extremely imortant that you say yes to things that you are certain about only.
