This book provides you a new way of looking at the world. It will help you with a realistic path towards a meaningful working life.

# The Passion Hypothesis
The key to occupational happiness is to first figure out what you're passionate about and then find a job that matches this passion. This is what the author calls the passion hypothesis. It promises you that you are just a few tests away from finding your dream job. This is a a terrible advice. 

# Passion is rare
It's hard to predict in advance what you'll eventually grow to love. Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion. The passion hypothesis is a assumption that we all have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered. A research found that the happiesnt and most passionate employees were not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead **those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do.**
